            <p>You use variables as symbolic names for values in your application. The names of variables, called identifiers, conform to certain rules.</p>

            <p>A JavaScript identifier must start with a letter, underscore (_), or dollar sign ($); subsequent characters can also be digits (0-9). Because JavaScript is case sensitive, letters include the characters "A" through "Z" (uppercase) and the
                characters "a" through "z" (lowercase).</p>

            <p>You can use ISO 8859-1 or Unicode letters such as å and ü in identifiers. You can also use the Unicode escape sequences as characters in identifiers. Some examples of legal names are Number_hits, temp99, and _name.</p>

                <li>After the second pass: n = 2 and x = 3</li>
                <li>After the third pass: n = 3 and x = 6</li>

            <header>Declaring Variables</header>
            <p>You can declare a variable in three ways:</p>
            <p>With the keyword var. For example,</p>
            <code>
                <pre>
var x = 42.
                </pre>
            </code>
            <p>This syntax can be used to declare both local and global variables.</p>

            <p>By simply assigning it a value. For example,</p>
            <code>
                <pre>
x = 42.
                </pre>
            </code>
            <p>This always declares a global variable. It generates a strict JavaScript warning. You shouldn't use this variant.</p>

            <p>With the keyword let. For example,</p>
            <code>
                <pre>
let y = 13.
                </pre>
            </code>
            <p>This syntax can be used to declare a block scope local variable. See Variable scope below.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="main-section" id="Variables_Scope">
            <header>Variables Scope</header>
            <p>When you declare a variable outside of any function, it is called a global variable, because it is available to any other code in the current document. When you declare a variable within a function, it is called a local variable, because it
                is available only within that function.
            </p>
            <p>
                JavaScript before ECMAScript 2015 does not have block statement scope; rather, a variable declared within a block is local to the function (or global scope) that the block resides within. For example the following code will log 5, because the scope of
                x is the function (or global context) within which x is declared, not the block, which in this case is an if statement.
            </p>
            <code>
                <pre>
if (true) { var x = 5; } console.log(x); // 5
                </pre>
            </code>
            <p>This behavior changes, when using the let declaration introduced in ECMAScript 2015.</p>
            <code>
                <pre>
if (true) { let y = 5; } console.log(y); // ReferenceError: y is not
defined
                </pre>
            </code>

            <ul>
                <li>The name of the function.</li>
                <li>A list of arguments to the function, enclosed in parentheses and separated by commas.</li>
                <li>The JavaScript statements that define the function, enclosed in curly brackets, { }.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section class="main-section" id="Global_Variables">
            <header>Global Variables</header>
            <p>
                Global variables are in fact properties of the global object. In web pages the global object is window, so you can set and access global variables using the window.variable syntax.
            </p>
            <p>
                Consequently, you can access global variables declared in one window or frame from another window or frame by specifying the window or frame name. For example, if a variable called phoneNumber is declared in a document, you can refer to this variable
                from an iframe as parent.phoneNumber.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section class="main-section" id="Constant">
            <header>Constant</header>
            <p>
                You can create a read-only, named constant with the const keyword. The syntax of a constant identifier is the same as for a variable identifier: it must start with a letter, underscore or dollar sign and can contain alphabetic, numeric, or underscore
                characters.
            </p>
            <code>
                <pre>
const PI = 3.14;
                </pre>
            </code>
            <p>
                A constant cannot change value through assignment or be re-declared while the script is running. It has to be initialized to a value.
            </p>
            <p>
                The scope rules for constants are the same as those for let block scope variables. If the const keyword is omitted, the identifier is assumed to represent a variable.
            </p>
            <p>
                You cannot declare a constant with the same name as a function or variable in the same scope. For example:
            </p>
            <code>
                <pre>
// THIS WILL CAUSE AN ERROR function f() {}; const f = 5; // THIS WILL
CAUSE AN ERROR ALSO function f() { const g = 5; var g; //statements
}
                </pre>
            </code>
            <p>
                However, object attributes are not protected, so the following statement is executed without problems.
            </p>
            <code>
                <pre>
const MY_OBJECT = {"key": "value"}; MY_OBJECT.key = "otherValue";
                </pre>
            </code>
